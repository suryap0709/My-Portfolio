            <h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Surya, and I'm delighted to share my journey into the world of data engineering with you.</p><br></br>
			<p>I started as a Junior Data Engineer at Netaxis IT Solutions. During my time there, I got work with Python, 
			and SQL, learning the fundamentals of data manipulation and processing.</p><br></br>
			<p>As I gained experience and confidence, I took on new challenges, eventually landing a role as a Data Engineer 
			and worked at Baxter Healthcare and Bed Bath & beyond for couple of years. This was a pivotal moment for me, as I 
			worked on big data technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and Scala and cloud platforms like GCP, AWS where I was tasked 
			with building robust data pipelines and optimizing processes for maximum efficiency.</p><br></br>
			<p>Today, I find myself at Capital Bank as a Senior Data Engineer, where I've been fortunate to lead initiatives and 
			drive innovation within the organization. My role helped me to apply my expertise in SQL query optimization, 
			Hadoop cluster management, and Python scripting to solve complex problems and deliver tangible results and I adopted 
			to azure cloud leveraging itâ€™s power to architect scalable and resilient data solutions.</p><br></br>
			<p>In summary, I bring over six years of hands-on experience in data engineering, coupled with a passion for innovation 
			and a relentless drive to succeed. I'm eager to bring my skills and expertise to a new role where I can make a meaningful 
			impact and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of data.</p><br></br>
